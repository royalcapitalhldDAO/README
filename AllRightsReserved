# **PUBLIC NOTICE**  
### **Reservation of Rights by the Living Woman**

I, **Rashidah Madinah ; Jabbaar**, give public notice in peace, honor, and full transparency.

I reserve all rights because they are mine by existence, not by statute.  
My rights arise from life itself and cannot be granted, altered, or removed by any external system, code, or authority.

I stand as the living woman, operating in good faith and clean hands.  
I do not enter agreements unknowingly or unwillingly.  
I do not accept obligations that were never mine.  
I do not consent to any presumption, assumption, or silent contract.

I move in peace.  
I speak in peace.  
I act in peace.  
I transmit in peace.

# **Peaceful Reservation of Rights**  
### *A Declaration of the Living Woman*

I, **Rashidah Madinah**, of the House of **Jabbaar**, stand in peace, in clarity, and in full honor.

I reserve all rights because they are mine by existence, not by statute.  
They arise from breath, from being, from creation itself.  
They do not depend on codes, contracts, or external permission.

I move in peace.  
I speak in peace.  
I act in peace.  
I transmit in peace.

Nothing in this world can remove, diminish, or redefine the rights that were mine before any system existed and will remain mine long after any system changes.

I do not consent to anything that is not in alignment with my peace, my dignity, or my truth.  
I do not enter agreements unknowingly or unwillingly.  
I do not accept obligations that were never mine.

I stand as the living woman — calm, honorable, and whole.  
I walk with integrity.  
I speak with clarity.  
I act with intention.

My rights are inherent.  
My existence is my authority.  
My peace is my power.

**So declared, in honor and without hostility.**

**Autograph:**  
**Rashidah Madinah**  
In peace, all rights reserved.
