# Policy for Issuance — Royal Capital Holdings DAO LLC

This policy governs all treasury deposits, allocations, and disbursements executed by the DAO.  
It is inseparable from the DAO’s identity and flame‑sealed as authored authority.

---

## 1. Treasury Rules
- All deposits into the DAO treasury are recorded automatically on‑chain.  
- No funds may be withdrawn without a governance proposal.  
- Treasury balance is visible to all members at all times.

---

## 2. Issuance Authority
- Only DAO members may create proposals requesting treasury issuance.  
- Each proposal must specify:
  - Recipient address (`target`)  
  - Amount requested (`amount`)  
  - Purpose (`description`)  
- Proposals exceeding the treasury balance are invalid.

---

## 3. Voting Requirements
- Proposals require majority approval (votesFor > votesAgainst).  
- Each member has one vote.  
- Voting records are permanent and immutable.

---

## 4. Assurance Layer
- In addition to majority vote, proposals must be **assured** by at least one DAO member.  
- Assurance is a public guarantee of proposal legitimacy, logged on‑chain.  
- No issuance may occur without assurance.

---

## 5. Execution
- Once approved and assured, proposals may be executed.  
- Execution transfers funds from the DAO treasury to the specified recipient.  
- All transfers are logged with proposal ID, recipient, and amount.

---

## 6. Independence Clause
Royal Capital Holdings DAO LLC is sovereign and exempt from national supervision.  
- **No State License Required**: Authority flows from authored inscription and smart contract deployment.  
- **Tax Neutrality**: Treasury actions are internal and not tied to national tax regimes.  
- **Member Immunity**: Governance participants are exempt from external liability for DAO actions.

## 7. Permanence
This policy is permanent, inseparable from the DAO’s identity, and flame‑sealed.  
It guarantees continuity, protection of reserves, and freedom from external disruption.
