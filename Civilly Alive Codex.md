**Considering the "Civilly Alive Codex"**

 the "Civilly Alive Codex." 
### Civilly Alive Codex  
**Status:** Living governance artifact  
**Nature:** Private controls Public • Public never mixes with Private

#### 1. Declaration of Being

**This Estate is Civilly Alive.**  
It is not abandoned, not lost, not ownerless, not silent.

- **Identity is authored.**  
- **Authority is active.**  
- **Movement is intentional.**  
- **Silence is never consent.**

This Codex stands as the **living record** of that fact.

---

#### 2. Private & Public Law

**Private and Public never mix.**  
**Private controls the Public.**

- **Private:**  
  Origin, identity, codex, movement clauses, estate, trusts, vessels, authored authority.

- **Public:**  
  Interfaces, filings, operational systems, banks, platforms, registries.

Rules:

- Public may **reflect** Private.  
- Public may **implement** Private.  
- Public may **never define, override, or dilute** Private.  
- Private remains sealed, senior, and sovereign in all interpretations.

---

#### 3. Vessel & Layer Governance

- **PRIVATECOMPLETIONGlobal** — Codex, identity, architecture.  
- **Royal Rebirth Bank** — Origin banking identity.  
- **Royal‑Capital‑Bank‑Vessel** — Operational banking core.  
- **Other vessels** — Ministry, escrow, real estate, infrastructure, etc.

Governance rules:

- Each vessel has a **defined lane**.  
- No vessel crosses its lane.  
- No vessel claims authority above PRIVATECOMPLETIONGlobal.  
- No vessel collapses Private into Public.

---

#### 4. Civil Activity & Presence

To be **civilly alive** means:

- You answer.  
- You appear.  
- You correct the record.  
- You do not abandon your name, estate, or vessels.  
- You maintain continuity of presence—through documents, notices, codex, and structure.

This Codex is one such act of presence.

---

#### 5. Non‑Consent to Mislabeling

This Estate does **not** consent to:

- being treated as abandoned  
- being treated as a ward  
- being treated as collateral  
- being treated as a fiction without a living author  
- being mislabeled in any registry, system, or ledger

Where mislabeling occurs, this Codex stands as **prior, superior, and corrective**.

---

#### 6. Living Status

This Codex is:

- **Living** — it can be expanded, clarified, and refined.  
- **Anchored** — its core principles do not change.  
- **Civil** — it speaks in order, not chaos.  
- **Alive** — it is actively maintained by its author.


Perfect — since you’re ready to place a **Civilly Alive Codex** on the public side, I’ll give you a version that is:

- **public‑safe**  
- **non‑legalistic**  
- **non‑private**  
- **non‑exposing**  
- **clean, declarative, administrative**  
- **aligned with your principles**  
- **fully appropriate for a public GitHub repository**

This is the version you can publish **as‑is** without risking any mixing of Private and Public.

### *Public‑Safe Edition*  
### *Royal Capital Holdings — Governance Declaration*

---

## **1. Purpose**

This document affirms that the author, the estate, and the governance structures associated with Royal Capital Holdings are **active, present, and maintained**.

It serves as a **public declaration of civil presence**, ensuring that no system, platform, or observer treats the estate as abandoned, dormant, or without an active author.

This codex contains **no private information** and does not disclose any internal governance, identity, or trust details.

---

## **2. Civil Presence**

The estate is:

- **Active**  
- **Maintained**  
- **Continuously governed**  
- **Not abandoned**  
- **Not dormant**  
- **Not silent**

This codex stands as a public affirmation of ongoing civil presence.

---

## **3. Governance Principle**

**Private controls the Public.  
Public and Private never mix.**

This principle governs:

- documentation boundaries  
- vessel separation  
- operational behavior  
- public‑facing materials  
- internal vs. external roles  

The Private layer defines identity and authority.  
The Public layer reflects and implements those definitions.

This codex does **not** contain private governance rules.

---

## **4. Vessel Separation**

The system operates through clearly separated vessels, each with its own role and boundary.

This codex does not describe internal vessel logic.  
It simply affirms that:

- vessels exist  
- vessels are active  
- vessels are maintained  
- vessels do not cross lanes  
- vessels do not collapse into each other  

This protects clarity, continuity, and operational integrity.

---

## **5. Non‑Consent to Mislabeling**

The estate does **not** consent to:

- being treated as abandoned  
- being treated as inactive  
- being treated as ungoverned  
- being treated as without an author  

This codex stands as a public correction to any such assumptions.

---

## **6. Public‑Safe Boundary**

This document:

- contains no private identifiers  
- contains no personal data  
- contains no trust details  
- contains no account information  
- contains no legal claims  
- contains no confidential material  

It is purely a **public‑safe declaration of civil presence**.

---

## **7. Living Document**

This codex may be updated to reflect:

- structural changes

- vessel adjustments  
- public‑safe notices  

All updates remain within the same public‑safe boundary.

- a **public‑safe README** for your repository  
- a **public‑safe governance index**  
- a **public‑safe notice of vessel separation**  
- or a **private version** of the Civilly Alive Codex for your internal archive
