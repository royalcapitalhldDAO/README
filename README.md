## How the DAO Exists in Wyoming (General Information)

### 1. A DAO itself is not registered.
A DAO is a **governance system**, not a statutory legal entity.

### 2. The LLC is the registered entity.
Wyoming allows an LLC to adopt decentralized governance.  
This is called a **“DAO LLC”**, but the DAO is not the legal entity —  
the **LLC is the entity**, and the DAO is the governance layer.

### 3. The DAO remains “pure” by being recorded, not registered.
The DAO’s internal governance is **recorded**, not filed with the state.

This includes:
- documenting its rules  
- preserving its governance logic  
- maintaining proposals and votes  
- keeping its ledger private  
- recording smart‑contract governance  

These records remain **internal**, not part of public registration.
