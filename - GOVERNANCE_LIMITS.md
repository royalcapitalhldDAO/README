Royal Capital Holdings DAO LLC  
Version 1.0 — Non-Override Constraints

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **absolute limits of governance authority** within Royal Capital Holdings DAO LLC.

Governance exists to **authorize**, not to own, execute, or appropriate.

No vote, proposal, committee decision, or majority outcome may override the limits defined herein.

These limits are permanent unless amended through a lawful, recorded, and threshold-qualified governance process.

---

## 2. Core Rule: Governance Is Not Power — It Is Permission

The DAO’s authority is **constrained by design**.

Governance may:
- Approve
- Deny
- Set conditions
- Define frameworks

Governance may **not**:
- Execute
- Possess
- Appropriate
- Represent ownership
- Rewrite foundational boundaries

---

## 3. Non-Delegable Prohibitions (Absolute)

The DAO **may never**, under any circumstance:

### A. Financial Control
- ❌ Hold custody of funds
- ❌ Control private keys
- ❌ Act as signer, co-signer, or custodian
- ❌ Pool, rehypothecate, or reharness assets
- ❌ Perform treasury execution

### B. Issuance & Asset Manipulation
- ❌ Mint, burn, or issue assets directly
- ❌ Alter supply mechanics
- ❌ Modify issuer smart contracts
- ❌ Create derivative exposure
- ❌ Create shadow instruments

### C. Ownership & Beneficial Claims
- ❌ Claim beneficial ownership
- ❌ Represent itself as owner or funder
- ❌ Assign or encumber trust or estate interests
- ❌ Convert governance authority into economic entitlement

Votes do not create ownership.

---

## 4. Governance Cannot Override Code Boundaries

No governance action may:
- Bypass smart-contract-enforced limits
- Suspend time locks or delays
- Disable quorum or threshold rules
- Retroactively validate unauthorized actions
- Grant itself emergency powers

Code-level constraints supersede human governance.

---

## 5. No Retroactive Authority

Governance may not:
- Ratify past unauthorized actions
- Approve historical executions after the fact
- Legitimize previously invalid transactions
- Reclassify violations as compliant

Invalid actions remain invalid permanently.

---

## 6. Committee Constraints

### Manager Committee
- Operates strictly within approved frameworks
- Cannot bypass DAO votes
- Cannot expand its own authority
- Cannot collapse roles across systems

Committee authority is **delegated**, not inherent.

---

## 7. No Emergency Exception Doctrine

There are **no emergency powers** that allow:
- Suspension of limits
- Temporary consolidation of roles
- Fast-tracked authority capture
- Crisis-based overrides

Stability is achieved through structure, not urgency.

---

## 8. Conflict of Interest Lock

Any individual or entity may not:
- Vote on matters that materially benefit them
- Participate in decisions affecting their own compensation, control, or influence
- Influence governance outcomes through indirect control

Conflicted votes are void.

---

## 9. Immutability Clause

The following sections are **structurally immutable**:
- Sections 2–7 of this document
- SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md references
- Separation of powers architecture

Amendment requires:
- Supermajority threshold
- Multi-phase delay
- Explicit statement of impact
- On-chain and off-chain record

Silence or inaction does not equal consent.

---

## 10. Interpretation Standard

In any ambiguity:
- Interpretation defaults to **least authority**
- Ambiguous powers are treated as **not granted**
- Economic rights are never implied

Authority must be explicit, narrow, and recorded.

---

## 11. Governing Law

This document operates in alignment with:
- Wyoming DAO LLC statutes (W.S. 17-31-101 et seq.)
- Contract law principles
- Smart-contract enforceability standards

---

## 12. Final Statement

Governance is strongest when it is limited.

This DAO exists to **protect the system from itself**, not to concentrate power.

Any action outside these limits is void ab initio.

Understood, Rashidah Madinah Jabbaar.  
You’ve spoken the filename directly — **GOVERNANCE_LIMITS.md** — so I will produce the **final, authoritative, GitHub‑ready version** in the same tone, structure, and institutional clarity as your SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md.

This becomes the **formal governance constraint instrument** for Royal Capital Holdings DAO LLC.

Calm. Precise. Non‑negotiable.

Royal Capital Holdings DAO LLC  
Version 1.0 — Authority Constraints & Non‑Expandable Powers

---

## **1. Purpose of This Document**

This document defines the **maximum allowable scope** of governance authority within Royal Capital Holdings DAO LLC.

Its purpose is to:

- Prevent governance overreach  
- Protect the issuer, estate, trust, and execution systems  
- Maintain statutory compliance  
- Ensure long‑term architectural integrity  
- Preserve authored authority and vessel separation  

No governance action, proposal, vote, or committee may exceed the limits defined herein.

---

## **2. Core Principle: Governance Cannot Become Execution**

Governance may **authorize**, but it may not:

- execute  
- mint  
- settle  
- issue  
- burn  
- transfer  
- operate systems  
- modify issuer logic  
- assume custodial control  

This separation is structural and cannot be collapsed.

---

## **3. Governance Powers — Explicitly Permitted**

The DAO may:

### **A. Policy & Framework Authority**

- Approve reserve policies  

### **B. Authorization Authority**
- Approve or deny execution requests

- Approve minting within limits  
- Approve system upgrades  
- Approve amendments to governance documents  

### **C. Recordkeeping Authority**
- Maintain immutable governance records  
- Publish public identifiers

These powers are **authoritative but not operational**.

The DAO may **not**:

### **A. Financial Control**
- ❌ Hold, custody, or manage funds  
- ❌ Execute transactions

### **B. Issuance Control**
- ❌ Mint assets directly  
- ❌ Burn assets directly  
- ❌ Modify issuer logic  
- ❌ Override supply caps  
- ❌ Issue assets outside approved parameters  

### **C. Structural Overreach**
- ❌ Collapse separation of powers  
- ❌ Absorb the issuer or execution system  
- ❌ Claim beneficial ownership  
- ❌ Override estate or trust authority  
- ❌ Expand its own powers unilaterally  

### **D. Legal Overreach**
- ❌ Represent itself as a financial institution  
- ❌ Provide financial, legal, or investment advice  
- ❌ Assume regulatory roles  

Governance is **authorization only**, never execution.

---

## **5. Limits on Amendments**

Governance may not amend:

- system boundaries  
- issuer logic  
- trust or estate instruments  
- statutory constraints  
- separation‑of‑powers architecture  

Amendments are allowed **only** where explicitly permitted and must:

- originate from a valid proposal  
- meet quorum  
- meet approval threshold  
- be immutably recorded  

No implied amendments exist.

---

## **6. Anti‑Concentration Safeguards**

To prevent governance capture:

- No single member may act unilaterally  
- No committee may override code‑enforced limits  
- No vote may grant powers prohibited in this document  
- No governance action may bypass the issuer or execution system  
- No emergency powers may collapse separation of roles  

Any attempt to centralize authority is invalid.

---

## **7. Relationship to Other Documents**

This document works in tandem with:

- SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md  
- ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md  
- Wyoming DAO Identifier  
- Operating Agreement  
- Governance Canon  

Where conflicts arise, **the most restrictive rule prevails**.

---

## **8. Governing Law**

This governance framework aligns with:

- Wyoming DAO LLC statutes (W.S. 17‑31‑101 et seq.)  
- Smart contract enforceability standards  
- Trust and fiduciary separation principles  

---

## **9. Final Statement**

Governance is strongest when it is **limited**.  
Authority is safest when it is **defined**.  
Power is most legitimate when it is **constrained**.

These limits are binding across all layers of the Royal Capital Holdings ecosystem.
