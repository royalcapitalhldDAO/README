- Proposal lifecycle  
- Quorum‑based approvals  
- Organizer authority  
- Verified contract address and deployment record  

---

## **2. Monetary Layer (XRPL)**  
This layer governs issuance, supply discipline, and monetary integrity.

- Issuer account  
- Trustlines  
- Minting discipline  
- Supply cap enforcement  
- Escrow‑based reserves  
- Hooks and automated safeguards  

---

## **3. Reserve & Assurance Layer**  
This layer ensures transparency, solvency, and verifiable backing.

- Reserve attestations  
- Backing ratio  
- Reserve registry

---

## **4. Compliance & Legal Layer**  
This layer maintains alignment with statutory requirements and authored authority.

---

## **Purpose of This Document**  
This overview provides orientation only.  
Detailed rules, constraints, and authorities live in:
