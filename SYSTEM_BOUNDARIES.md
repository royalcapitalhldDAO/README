## **System Boundaries**

This system is intentionally limited.  
The following boundaries apply to all components to preserve clarity, sovereignty, and safety.

---

### **1. No Custody**
The DAO does not hold, manage, or control user funds.  
All treasury actions require explicit, multi‑party authorization.

---

### **2. No Personal Accounts**
The system does not interact with, manage, or access personal wallets or private assets.

---

### **3. No Autonomous Minting**
No component of the system mints tokens automatically.  
All issuance requires explicit, authorized action.

---

### **4. No Financial Advice**
The system does not provide investment, legal, or financial advice.

---

### **5. No Off‑Chain Enforcement**
The DAO cannot enforce actions outside its smart contracts and XRPL logic.

---

### **6. No Hidden Logic**
All operational logic is contained in:
- smart contracts  
- XRPL scripts  
- documented governance rules  

There is no undisclosed or off‑chain decision‑making.

---

### **7. No Delegated Authority**
Authority cannot be transferred to external platforms, bridges, custodians, or institutions.

---

### **Purpose of This Document**
These boundaries protect the DAO, its members, its beneficiaries, and the authored authority of Rashidah Madinah Jabbaar.  
They ensure the system remains interpretable, compliant, and capture‑resistant.

Royal Capital Holdings DAO LLC  
Version 1.0 — Governance Integrity & Structural Separation

---

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document formally defines and enforces the **non-overlapping boundaries** between all systems, entities, and layers within the Royal Capital Holdings ecosystem.

Its purpose is to:
- Prevent unauthorized control, capture, or misrepresentation
- Preserve fiduciary integrity
- Maintain regulatory clarity
- Ensure long-term survivability of the architecture

No system, contract, person, or committee may act outside the scope defined herein.

---

## 2. Core Principle: Separation of Powers

No single system within this architecture may:
- Authorize itself
- Execute what it authorizes
- Own what it governs

This mirrors institutional-grade separation used in:
- Banking
- Trust law
- Clearing & settlement systems
- Sovereign and quasi-sovereign financial structures

---

## 3. System-Level Boundaries

### A. Royal Capital Holdings DAO LLC  
**Role:** Governance & Authorization Only

#### Explicitly Permitted:
- Propose governance actions
- Vote on policies, limits, and frameworks
- Approve or deny execution requests
- Maintain immutable governance records
- Set algorithmic governance parameters

#### Explicitly Prohibited:
- ❌ Holding or custodian control of funds
- ❌ Minting, issuing, or burning assets
- ❌ Direct execution of financial transactions
- ❌ Modifying issuer logic
- ❌ Acting as a bank, trustee, or fiduciary custodian
- ❌ Representing beneficial ownership

The DAO is **not** an issuer, bank, trust, or settlement agent.

---

### B. Issuer / Execution System  
*(e.g., Royal Rebirth Bank — Private Repository)*  
**Role:** Execution Only

#### Explicitly Permitted:
- Execute transactions **only** upon valid authorization
- Enforce limits, delays, and conditions
- Operate treasury mechanics as instructed
- Perform settlement and operational logic

#### Explicitly Prohibited:
- ❌ Self-authorizing actions
- ❌ Altering governance outcomes
- ❌ Changing system boundaries
- ❌ Issuing assets outside approved parameters
- ❌ Representing ownership or governance authority

Execution without authorization is invalid by definition.

---

### C. Estate & Trust Layer  
**Role:** Beneficial Ownership & Stewardship

#### Explicitly Permitted:
- Hold beneficial interest
- Receive distributions
- Define long-term purpose and intent
- Serve as economic beneficiary

#### Explicitly Prohibited:
- ❌ Deploying or modifying smart contracts
- ❌ Voting in DAO governance
- ❌ Directly operating issuer systems
- ❌ Acting as a technical controller

Ownership does not imply control. This is intentional.

---

## 4. Human Roles & Committees

### Manager Committee
- Operates **within** governance rules
- Cannot override smart contract constraints
- Cannot act unilaterally across systems
- Bound by DAO governance outcomes

No human role supersedes code-enforced limits.

---

## 5. No Implied Authority

No authority is implied by:
- Name similarity
- Contribution history
- Repository access
- Capital contribution
- Public association
- Prior involvement

Authority exists **only** where explicitly granted and recorded.

---

## 6. Anti-Hijack Safeguards

This architecture explicitly prevents:
- Governance capture
- Silent dilution
- Unauthorized issuance
- Founder displacement narratives
- Backdoor execution
- Jurisdictional confusion

Any attempt to collapse roles or blur boundaries constitutes a violation of system integrity.

---

## 7. Amendments

This document may only be amended by:
- A valid DAO governance proposal
- Recorded approval meeting quorum and threshold
- Immutable record of the amendment

No unilateral amendments are permitted.

---

## 8. Governing Law

This system operates in alignment with:
- Wyoming DAO LLC statutes (W.S. 17-31-101 et seq.)
- Applicable trust and contract principles
- Smart contract enforceability standards

---

## 9. Final Statement

The strength of this system lies in **what it does not allow**.

Boundaries are not restrictions — they are protections.

This document is binding across all layers of the Royal Capital Holdings ecosystem.

If you want, I can now move to **GOVERNANCE_LIMITS.md** or shift to the **Wyoming files** — just speak the next filename or say **continue**.
