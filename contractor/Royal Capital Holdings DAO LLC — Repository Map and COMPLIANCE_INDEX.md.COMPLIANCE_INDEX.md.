## Tri-Ledger Settlement Architecture

1. **GitHub Ledger (Authored Authority)**
   - Files: `README.md`, `DAO_IDENTIFIER.md`, `COMPLIANCE_INDEX.md`, `POLICY_FOR_ISSUANCE.md`, `Record-Keeping Index`.
   - Function: Human-readable governance, policy, and narrative authority.

2. **EVM Ledger (Programmable Enforcement)**
   - Contracts: `RoyalCapitalDAO`, `ManagerField`, `PublicCompliance`, `RoyalCapitalDAOIdentifier`.
   - Function: Proposal lifecycle, voting, execution, and policy enforcement hooks.

3. **XRP Ledger (External Financial Settlement)**
   - Function: Final clearing of external value transfers and obligations.
   - XRP transaction hashes are recorded in the Record-Keeping Index alongside EVM tx hashes and proposal IDs.

This creates a closed, auditable loop:

- Intent and policy → GitHub  
- Governance and execution → EVM  
- External settlement → XRP  
- Full traceability → Record-Keeping Index
